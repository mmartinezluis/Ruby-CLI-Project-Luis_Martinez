# Quotes App
Welcome to QuotesApp. QuotesApp is a Ruby command-line-interface app for displaying random quotes, quotes from authors, and quotes from categories. QuotesApp is my first milestone project at the Flatiron Software Engineering program, and it is fully written in object-oriented Ruby. You may find my Medium blog post for QuotesApp [here](https://medium.com/swlh/object-oriented-ruby-and-my-first-ruby-project-quotes-app-d47cec3585f1).
